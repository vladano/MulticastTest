To generate haelp file in diffrent file format I used free softver chmprocessor from location http://chmprocessor.sourceforge.net/
"chmProcessor is a tool for creating HTML help (CHM files) from MS Word or HTML files."

You need to download and install that software to your computer.
After that, you need to write yout help as MS Word dokument. That document will be use as source for chmProcessor tool to generate dokumentation of diffrent file types.
